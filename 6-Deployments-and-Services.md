# Services and Deployments

So the pod is up, now how do we access it?

In Kubernetes, there is an object type called a `service` which functions as a load balancer. What this means is that if someone needs to talk to or access a `Pod`, then they need to go through the `Service`.

We can create a service for your pod with the following command:


### 

Creating a service

Curling the service

What happens when we delete a pod?

### Deployments

Creating a deployment

Listing the deployment

Listing the pods "inside" a deployment
